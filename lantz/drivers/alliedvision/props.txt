PayloadSize (Size of the payload in bytes. This is the total number of bytes sent in the payload. Image data + chunk data if present. No packet headers.):	12288000
GevSCPSPacketSize (Packet size in bytes for the selected stream channel. Excludes data leader and data trailer. (The last packet may be smaller because the packet size is not necessarily a multiple of the block size for the stream channel.)):	1500
GevSCPD (Delay between the transmission of each packet for the selected stream channel. The delay is measured in ticks.):	0
GevSCFTD (Frame transmission delay for the selected stream channel (in ticks). This value sets a delay before transmitting the acquired image.):	0
GevSCBWR (Percentage of the Ethernet bandwidth assigned to the camera to be held in reserve for packet resends and for the transmission of control data between the camera and the host PC. The setting is expressed as a percentage of the bandwidth assigned parameter. For example, if the Bandwidth Assigned parameter indicates that 30 MBytes/s have been assigned to the camera and the Bandwidth Reserve parameter is set to 5%, the bandwidth reserve will be 1.5 MBytes/s.):	10
GevSCBWRA (Multiplier for the Bandwidth Reserve parameter. The multiplier is used to establish an extra pool of reserved bandwidth that can be used if an unusually large burst of packet resends is needed.):	10
GevSCBWA (Base bandwidth in bytes per second that will be used by the camera to transmit image and chunk feature data and to handle resends and control data transmissions. This parameter represents a combination of the packet size and the inter-packet delay.):	125000000
GevSCDMT (Maximum amount of data (in bytes per second) that the camera could generate given its current settings and ideal conditions, i.e., unlimited bandwidth and no packet resends.):	124369426
